# harness-configs

Portable AI coding-harness configs: shared skills, commands, rules, agents, and settings for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and the [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) coding agent, provisioned across multiple profiles from one source of truth.

This is a personal dotfiles-style repo, not a product.
It is published so other AI developers can borrow the architecture and the tooling.
Paths are hardcoded to one machine; adapt them before adopting (see [Adopt it](#adopt-it)).

## Ideas worth stealing

- **One source of truth, many harnesses.**
  A single `skills/` tree feeds Claude Code *and* pi.
  `claude/` config is symlinked into two Claude profiles; `pi/` is stowed into `~/.pi`.
  Edit once, every harness sees it immediately.
- **Two Claude profiles via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.**
  `pclaude` / `wclaude` wrappers point Claude Code at `~/.claude-personal` or `~/.claude-work`, so personal and work accounts stay isolated but share the same skills and global instructions.
- **Per-resource source tracking.**
  Each skill/agent carries a `.source.json` sidecar recording its origin repo, subpath, ref, and resolved commit, so a vendored one can be updated later with one command — vendoring without losing provenance, and locally-authored ones are marked too.
- **Guardrail extensions for pi.**
  Confirm-before-destructive, dirty-repo guard, protected paths, and a permission gate run as agent extensions, not as hope.
- **Desired-state plugins.**
  `plugins.txt` is the declared plugin set; `make plugins-check` reports drift per profile.
- **Borrow a popular CLI's discovery without adopting its model.**
  `make skills-find` / `skills-add` front the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI (the skills.sh ecosystem) for discovery and fetching, but pipe the result back into the repo's own vendoring + `.source.json` tracking — so the dual profiles, subagent management, and committed/offline skills all survive.

## How it wires together

`make install` provisions everything and is safe to re-run:

- Symlinks `skills/` into `~/.pi/skills`, `~/.claude-personal/skills`, `~/.claude-work/skills`.
- Symlinks `claude/CLAUDE.md`, `commands/`, `rules/`, `scripts/`, `agents/` into both Claude profiles.
- Stows `pi/` into `~/.pi` (settings, prompts, extensions).

Because `skills/` and `claude/` are symlinks, an edit in this repo applies to every profile and both harnesses at once — no copy step.
The `Makefile` derives all paths from `$(CURDIR)`, so the repo can live anywhere.

## What's inside

### Skills

Shared by Claude Code and pi, grouped below by the `category` recorded in each skill's sidecar.
Most are now authored in this repo (`local`); the rest are vendored from [pi-skills](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills) (`brave-search`, the Google CLIs, `transcribe`, `vscode`, `youtube-transcript`), the [cursor-team-kit](https://github.com/cursor/plugins) (`deslop`, `make-pr-easy-to-review`, `pr-review-canvas`, `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`), and the [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/) ecosystem (`find-skills`, `agent-browser`, `caveman`).
Each carries a `.source.json` sidecar recording its source and a `category`; `make skills-list` prints them grouped by that category (the same groups as the tables below — Claude Code/pi only scan one level deep, so categorization is metadata, not nested folders).
To find more, `make skills-find Q=…` searches [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/) and `make skills-add SOURCE=owner/repo@skill CATEGORY=…` vendors the result into `skills/` (see [Makefile reference](#makefile-reference)).

The owned skills lean heavily toward maintaining a Hugo site and an OSS Go project end-to-end — authoring, CI triage, dependency hygiene, security remediation, and backlog/PR review — each one atomic so it can run alone or chain with the others.

The tables below are **generated** from the sidecars + each `SKILL.md` description — don't edit them by hand; run `make skills-catalog` after adding, removing, or recategorizing a skill (`make skills-doctor` flags a stale block).

### Claude commands, agents, rules, scripts

- **Command** `/history` — read the global conversation history and present it in a scannable format.
- **Agents** (each with a `.source.json` sidecar, listed by `make agents-list`):
  - `plan-reviewer` — read-only pre-execution review of an implementation plan against the actual codebase; returns APPROVE/REVISE with evidence-cited issues.
  - `bulk-mechanic` — haiku-powered executor for mechanical, judgment-free batches (renames, bumps, pattern application); the parent supplies the exact transform and file list.
  - `pr-shepherd` — drives the push → CI → bot-review loop to green via the `watch-ci` / `debug-ci` / `resolve-bot-review-threads` skills; never opens or merges PRs itself.
  - `skill-auditor` — read-only audit of a skill directory against the repo's conventions (atomic scope, trigger-rich description, sidecar + category, no PII).
  - `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` — strict maintainability audit (1k-line rule, spaghetti, code-judo), driven by the matching skill; vendored from the cursor-team-kit.
- **Rules** (`claude/rules/`, loaded in every session in both profiles):
  - `model-routing.md` — route tasks to the cheapest reliable model tier (haiku mechanical / sonnet routine / session model for judgment) and calibrate effort.
  - `git-hygiene.md` — staging, commit, and push discipline.
  - `delegation.md` — when to hand work to the subagents above instead of doing it inline.
- **Scripts** — `md-one-sentence-per-line.py` (the markdown formatter the shared `CLAUDE.md` points at) and `statusline-command.sh` (a `statusLine` hook script: `[model] folder | branch · context bar · $cost · elapsed`).

### Shared `CLAUDE.md`

Profile-agnostic global instructions applied to both Claude accounts:

- Never publish secrets; never commit `.env`.
- A pointer to the `claude/rules/` files above, so every session knows they exist.
- Markdown one-sentence-per-line, with a reusable formatter at `claude/scripts/md-one-sentence-per-line.py`.

### pi extensions

TypeScript extensions stowed into `~/.pi/extensions`, vendored from the [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) examples:

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `confirm-destructive` | Confirm before destructive actions. |
| `dirty-repo-guard` | Guard against operating on a dirty git repo. |
| `protected-paths` | Block edits to protected paths. |
| `permission-gate` | Gate tool permissions. |
| `handoff` | Transfer context to a new focused session. |
| `notify` | Surface notifications on events. |
| `mac-system-theme` | Sync the pi theme with macOS dark/light mode. |
| `status-line` | Custom status line. |
| `todo` | Todo state via session entries (state-management demo). |
| `subagent/` | Subagent dispatch (directory extension). |

### Plugins

`claude/plugins.txt` is the desired, user-scoped plugin set (installed manually per profile): `superpowers`, `frontend-design`, `context7`, `gopls-lsp`, `pr-review-toolkit`, `serena` — all from `claude-plugins-official`.

## Adopt it

Prerequisites: `git`, [GNU `stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), and `jq`.
`gh` is needed only for the GitHub-facing skills; `python3` for the markdown formatter and the Python-backed skills (`generate-og-images`, `report-site-analytics`, `transcribe`, …); `npx` (Node.js) only for the `skills-find` / `skills-add` discovery targets.
Individual skills declare their own extra tools (svgo, hugo, the Brave API key, etc.) in their `SKILL.md`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sanketsudake/harness-configs.git ~/personal/harness-configs
cd ~/personal/harness-configs
```

Before `make install`, adapt the parts that are personal to this machine:

- **Profiles.**
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS` in the `Makefile` lists `~/.claude-personal` and `~/.claude-work`.
  Change, add, or remove profiles there.
- **Wrappers.**
  Copy the `pclaude` / `wclaude` snippets from `scripts/claude-multi-account.sh` into your shell profile, pointing `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at your dirs.
- **Global rules.**
  `claude/CLAUDE.md` is opinionated — make it yours.

Then:

```sh
make install      # symlink claude/ + skills/ into profiles, stow pi/ into ~/.pi
make skills-list  # see each skill's source and status
```

`make uninstall` reverses it.

## Makefile reference

All targets follow `<resource>-<action>`; `install` / `uninstall` are the aggregates.

| Target | Does |
|--------|------|
| `install` / `uninstall` | Link/stow everything into the profiles, or reverse it. |
| `skills-sync` | Bulk-vendor the [pi-skills](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills) set into `skills/`. |
| `extensions-sync` | Vendor the whitelisted pi-mono extensions into `pi/extensions/`. |
| `skills-find [Q=… OWNER=…]` | Discover skills on [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/) via the `skills` CLI; prints `owner/repo@skill` hits. |
| `skills-add SOURCE=… [SKILL=… CATEGORY=…]` | Fetch from skills.sh/GitHub via the `skills` CLI and vendor into `skills/` with a `.source.json` (optionally tagged `CATEGORY=`). |
| `skills-fetch REPO=… SUBPATH=… [CATEGORY=…]` | Fetch one skill from any repo/subpath and write its `.source.json`. |
| `agents-fetch REPO=… SUBPATH=…` | Same, for a single agent `.md` file. |
| `skills-list` / `agents-list` | Every resource with status (`remote`/`local`/`unmanaged`) and source, **grouped by category**. |
| `skills-category NAME=… CATEGORY=…` | Set/replace a resource's category (survives `skills-update`). |
| `skills-catalog [CHECK=1]` | Regenerate the category-grouped skill tables in this README (or just verify with `CHECK=1`). |
| `skills-doctor` / `agents-doctor` | Validate every resource (frontmatter, sidecar, category) and, for skills, that the README catalog is current. |
| `skills-update NAME=…` / `-update-all` | Re-resolve the recorded ref and re-copy if upstream moved (category preserved). |
| `skills-delete NAME=…` | Remove a resource and its sidecar. |
| `plugins-check` | Diff `plugins.txt` against each profile's installed plugins. |
| `plugins-sync` | Emit the exact `/plugin install` lines to close the drift. |

`agents-*` twins exist for every `skills-*` target.
Use `SUBPATH=`, never `PATH=` — the latter would clobber the shell `PATH` inside recipes.

## Notes

- `skills/` and `pi/extensions/` are treated as vendored.
  A re-sync or `skills-update` overwrites local edits — diverge intentionally and note it durably.
- A `.source.json` is regenerated on fetch/update, so don't hand-edit it; locally authored resources carry `{"repo": null}` and survive `update-all` untouched.
- Plugin installation is manual per profile — Claude Code has no headless `/plugin install`; the Makefile only reports drift.

## License

[Apache-2.0](LICENSE).
Vendored skills and extensions remain under their upstream licenses; see each resource's `.source.json` for its origin.
