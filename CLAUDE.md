# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A dotfiles-style config repo that provisions two tools across two Claude profiles (personal/work):

- **pi** (the `pi-mono` coding agent) — config lives under `pi/` and is stowed into `~/.pi` via GNU stow.
- **Claude Code** — a shared global `CLAUDE.md`, `skills/`, `commands/`, `rules/`, `scripts/`, and `agents/` are symlinked into `~/.claude-personal/` and `~/.claude-work/`.

There is no application to build/test/lint.
The `Makefile` is the primary interface.

## Makefile targets

All targets follow a `<resource>-<action>` naming convention (e.g. `skills-link`, `skills-sync`), except the `install`/`uninstall` aggregates.

- `make install` — runs `skills-materialize` (reconstructs the gitignored vendored skill dirs from `skills/vendored.json`), then `skills-link`, `claude-md-link`, `commands-link`, `rules-link`, `scripts-link`, `agents-link`, then `stow --adopt pi` into `~/.pi`.
  Safe to re-run; it replaces existing symlinks and backs up real files it would overwrite.
  Materialization needs network on a fresh clone; offline, already-present vendored skills are left as-is and missing ones are reported as skipped.
- `make uninstall` — reverses the above.
- `make skills-sync` — clones/pulls `github.com/badlogic/pi-skills` into `/tmp/pi-skills` and copies each skill dir into `./skills/`.
  Bulk vendoring of the badlogic set; local edits to files under those `skills/<upstream-name>/` dirs are overwritten on next sync.
  For single skills from arbitrary repos, use `skills-fetch` (see "Skill & agent source management" below).
- `make extensions-sync` — clones/pulls `github.com/badlogic/pi-mono` into `/tmp/pi-mono` and copies the whitelisted set (see `PI_EXTENSIONS` in the Makefile) from `packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions` into `./pi/extensions/`.
  Same vendoring caveat applies.
- `make plugins-check` — diffs `claude/plugins.txt` (desired, user-scoped) against `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR>/plugins/installed_plugins.json` for each profile, reporting missing/extra.
  Requires `jq`.
- `make plugins-sync` — same diff as `plugins-check` but emits the exact `/plugin install <name>` lines per profile, prefixed with the wrapper to enter (`pclaude` / `wclaude`).
  Copy-paste into a session in the right profile to close the drift.
  Installation itself stays manual — Claude Code has no headless `/plugin install`.

## Skill & agent source management

`scripts/resource-manager.sh` (wrapped by the `skills-*` and `agents-*` make targets) fetches individual **skills** or **agents** from any git repo at any subpath and tracks where each came from, so they can be updated later.
It is repo tooling and lives in top-level `scripts/`, not `claude/scripts/` — it is not symlinked into the profiles.
Requires `git` and `jq`.

The tool takes a leading `--kind skill|agent`; the make targets supply it.
The two kinds differ in structure:

- A **skill** is a directory under `skills/` validated by a `SKILL.md`.
- An **agent** is a single `.md` file under `claude/agents/`; its sidecar is a **sibling** at `claude/agents/<name>.source.json`.

They also differ in what gets committed, which turns on a resource's **provenance**:

- **Vendored** — fetched from an upstream repo (`repo != null`).
  We don't author it; this repo just tracks a pin.
- **Authored** — born in this repo (`repo: null`, e.g. `harvest-automation`, `itr-india`); this repo is its only home.
  `update` and `delete` treat it as having no upstream.

**Vendored skills are not committed** (see `docs/adr/0001-vendored-skills-manifest.md`).
They are recorded in a single committed manifest, `skills/vendored.json` — a name-sorted array of `{name, repo, subpath, ref, commit, category, description}`, where `commit` is the resolved SHA of `ref` and `category`/`description` are cached so the catalog and doctor render without materializing.
Each vendored skill's `skills/<name>/` dir — including its regenerated `.source.json` sidecar — is **gitignored** (a managed block in `.gitignore`, rewritten by the tool) and **materialized** from the pinned `commit` by `make install`.
So for skills the manifest is the source of truth; the on-disk `.source.json` is a materialization artifact, not the committed record.

**Authored skills stay committed** as normal `skills/<name>/` dirs with a `{"repo": null}` sidecar, exactly as before — they survive materialize and `skills-update-all` untouched.

**Agents are always committed** (the manifest is skills-only): each carries a `.source.json` sidecar — `{"repo","subpath","ref","commit","fetched_at"}` when remote, `{"repo": null, ...}` when local; an agent with no sidecar is reported `unmanaged`.

An optional `category` field groups a resource in `list`/catalog output (for vendored skills it lives in the manifest entry; for authored skills and agents, in the sidecar).
Skills are categorized this way rather than by folder because Claude Code and pi scan `skills/` only one level deep, so nesting skills into category subfolders would hide them.

Targets (each `skills-*` has an `agents-*` twin taking the same variables):

- `make skills-fetch REPO=owner/name SUBPATH=path/to/skill [REF=main] [NAME=…] [FORCE=1]` — shallow sparse-clone, validate the subpath, copy it into `skills/<NAME>/`; for a vendored skill it also upserts the `skills/vendored.json` entry (pinned `commit` + cached `category`/`description`) and adds the `.gitignore` line, so the fetched dir lands untracked.
  Refuses to overwrite unless `FORCE=1`.
  A full GitHub URL also works: `URL='https://github.com/owner/name/tree/<ref>/<subpath>'`.
- `make skills-materialize [NAME=…] [FORCE=1]` — reconstruct the gitignored vendored skill dirs from the manifest pins (git-init + shallow fetch of the exact `commit` + sparse-checkout).
  Idempotent: skips a dir whose `.source.json` already records the pinned commit unless `FORCE=1`.
  A full run also **reconciles down**: a vendored dir that has fallen out of the manifest (e.g. a `skills-delete` that landed via `git pull` on another machine) is pruned, so the on-disk vendored set matches the manifest instead of leaving a deleted skill live in the profiles.
  Pruning is guarded to untracked dirs whose `.source.json` still names a `repo`, so a committed authored skill is never removed.
  `NAME=` materializes just that one and prunes nothing.
  `make install` runs this first; it never fails the build offline — unreachable skills are warned and skipped.
- `make agents-fetch REPO=owner/name SUBPATH=path/to/agent.md [REF=main] [NAME=…] [FORCE=1]` — same, but the subpath is a `.md` file (NAME defaults to its basename minus `.md`), copied into `claude/agents/<NAME>.md`.
  Accepts a `/blob/` URL too.
  `fetch` also takes an optional `CATEGORY=…` to tag the sidecar on the way in.
- `make skills-list` / `make agents-list` — every resource with its status (`remote`/`local`/`unmanaged`) and source, grouped under a `<category> (<count>)` header (uncategorized last-ish, sorted).
- `make skills-category NAME=… CATEGORY=…` / `make agents-category NAME=… CATEGORY=…` — set/replace a resource's category in place: for a vendored skill it updates the `skills/vendored.json` entry; for an authored skill or agent it updates the `.source.json` sidecar (creating a minimal local one if none exists).
  Use kebab-case slugs that match the README's domain groups.
- `make skills-update NAME=…` / `make agents-update NAME=…` — re-resolve the recorded `ref`; if the upstream commit moved, pin the new commit and re-copy, else report up to date (prints `old→new`, preserving `category`).
  For a vendored skill this re-materializes the dir and rewrites its `skills/vendored.json` entry (refreshing the cached `description`); for an agent it rewrites the sidecar.
  Skips `local`/authored and `unmanaged`.
- `make skills-update-all` / `make agents-update-all` — update every remote resource of that kind.
- `make skills-delete NAME=… [YES=1]` / `make agents-delete NAME=… [YES=1]` — remove the resource; for a vendored skill this also drops its `skills/vendored.json` entry and `.gitignore` line, for an agent it removes both the `.md` and its sidecar.
  Prompts unless `YES=1`.
- `make skills-catalog [CHECK=1]` — regenerate the standalone catalog at `skills/README.md` (category-grouped tables).
  Vendored skills' `category`/`description` come from `skills/vendored.json`; authored skills' come from their `.source.json` `category` + `SKILL.md` frontmatter `description` (first sentence, truncated) — so the catalog regenerates correctly even on a bare checkout where the vendored dirs aren't materialized.
  The main `README.md` just links to it.
  Run it after adding, removing, or recategorizing a skill; `CHECK=1` only verifies (exit 1 if stale).
- `make skills-doctor` / `make agents-doctor` — validate every resource: for skills, the manifest is well-formed (required fields, no duplicate names, every vendored dir gitignored), each authored dir has a `SKILL.md` + sidecar with `category`, and no dir is a stale vendored orphan (a `.source.json` naming a `repo` with no manifest entry — `skills-materialize` prunes these), plus `skills/README.md` is current; for agents, markdown present with non-empty frontmatter `name`/`description` and a sidecar carrying a `category`.
  Exit 1 on any issue.
- `make suites-catalog [CHECK=1]` — regenerate (or verify) the generated blocks in `suites/*/README.md` and the Suites index in `README.md` (see "Skill suites").

Note: the make variable is `SUBPATH`, not `PATH` — `PATH=` on a make command line would clobber the shell `PATH` inside recipes and break `git`/`jq`.

## Skill suites

A **suite** is a curated, ordered set of skills with a shareable landing page — pure metadata + docs, the flat `skills/` tree is untouched.

- `suites/<name>/suite.json` — `{"title", "tagline"?, "skills": [ordered skill names]}`; membership lives here, never in sidecars.
- `suites/<name>/README.md` — hand-written narrative; the region between `<!-- suite-skills:begin/end -->` markers (skill table + skills.sh install command) is generated.
- The main `README.md`'s `<!-- suites:begin/end -->` region (the Suites index) is generated too; `skills/README.md` remains owned by `skills-catalog` alone.
- `make suites-catalog [CHECK=1]` regenerates (or verifies) all generated regions; `make skills-doctor` includes the check.
- To add a suite: create the dir with `suite.json` + a README containing the markers, then run `make suites-catalog`.

## skills.sh discovery + fetch (the `skills` CLI)

`scripts/skills-vendor.sh` (wrapped by `skills-find` / `skills-add`) is a thin front-end onto the vercel-labs [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI — the [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/) ecosystem — for **discovering** skills the repo doesn't already track and **fetching** them into `skills/`.
Requires `npx` (Node.js) and `jq`; it also relies on `resource-manager.sh`.

- `make skills-find [Q=query] [OWNER=org]` — `npx skills find`; prints ranked skills.sh hits as `owner/repo@skill`.
- `make skills-add SOURCE=owner/repo [SKILL='a b'] [ALL=1] [REF=…] [CATEGORY=…] [FORCE=1]` — fetch + vendor.
  `SOURCE` accepts the `owner/repo@skill` form `skills-find` prints (paste it verbatim); the `@skill` suffix is peeled into a selected skill.
  `CATEGORY=` tags every skill fetched in the call (it flows through to `resource-manager.sh`'s sidecar).

The integration is deliberately **hybrid**, not a replacement for `resource-manager.sh`.
`skills-vendor.sh` uses the CLI only as a *resolver/fetcher*: it runs `skills add … --copy` into a throwaway staging dir, reads the CLI's project `skills-lock.json` (per skill: `source`, `sourceType`, `skillPath`), then re-vendors each through `resource-manager.sh fetch`.
So a CLI-fetched skill is recorded in `skills/vendored.json` and gitignored/materialized **exactly like any other vendored skill**, and `skills-list` / `skills-update` / `skills-delete` plus the Makefile symlinks keep working unchanged — no second update mechanism, no CLI lockfile committed to the repo.

Why not let the `skills` CLI own installation directly (its `add`/`update`/`experimental_install`):

- Its agent→path map is fixed (`claude-code` → `~/.claude/skills`); it ignores `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so it can't target the two profiles (`~/.claude-personal`, `~/.claude-work`) — which our single symlinked `skills/` tree already serves.
- It manages skills only, not the `claude/agents/` subagents (`resource-manager.sh --kind agent` still owns those).
- It installs into per-agent dirs from its own canonical copy; this repo's reproducibility comes from the pinned `skills/vendored.json` manifest (materialized deterministically from each recorded `commit`), so our vendoring pipeline stays the backbone.

## Architecture notes that are easy to miss

- **Two Claude profiles via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.**
  `scripts/claude-multi-account.sh` is documentation (shell-function snippets to copy into `~/.zprofile`), not something that runs.
  The `pclaude`/`wclaude` wrappers set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to `~/.claude-personal` or `~/.claude-work`.
  Both dirs share the same `CLAUDE.md` and `skills/` via symlinks maintained by the Makefile — changes to `claude/CLAUDE.md` or `skills/` immediately apply to both profiles.
- **`claude/CLAUDE.md` is the shared global user CLAUDE.md**, not this file.
  It gets symlinked to `~/.claude-personal/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.claude-work/CLAUDE.md` by `claude-md-link`.
  Keep it minimal and profile-agnostic.
- **`pi/` is stowed with `--adopt`.**
  On first `make install`, stow moves any pre-existing files in `~/.pi` into this repo, replacing them with symlinks.
  That means `pi/agent/settings.json`, `pi/extensions/*.ts`, and `pi/prompts/` are the live files the agent reads — edits here take effect immediately in `~/.pi/...`.
  The `.pi/` directory in the repo root is unrelated scaffolding (empty).
- **`pi/extensions/subagent/` is a directory extension** (listed without `.ts` suffix in `PI_EXTENSIONS`); the rest are single-file TS extensions.
  Adding a new upstream extension requires editing `PI_EXTENSIONS` in the Makefile.
- **`skills/` is the single source of truth** for skills across pi and both Claude profiles.
  `skills-link` symlinks `$(CURDIR)/skills` into `~/.pi/skills`, `~/.claude-personal/skills`, `~/.claude-work/skills`.
  What's *committed* under it, though, is only the authored skill dirs plus the `skills/vendored.json` manifest; vendored skill dirs are gitignored and materialized into place (see the manifest model above), so the symlinked tree the tools read is authored-committed + vendored-materialized.
- **`claude/commands/`, `claude/rules/`, `claude/scripts/`, and `claude/agents/`** are the single source of truth for user-scoped slash commands, rules, helper scripts, and subagents across both Claude profiles.
`commands-link` / `rules-link` / `scripts-link` / `agents-link` symlink them into `~/.claude-personal/` and `~/.claude-work/` (not into `~/.pi/` — pi doesn't consume these; pi has its own vendored `pi/extensions/subagent/agents/`).
The shared `CLAUDE.md` references scripts via `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/scripts/...` so the path resolves correctly under either profile.
`claude/scripts/` currently holds `md-one-sentence-per-line.py` (referenced by the shared `CLAUDE.md`) and `statusline-command.sh` (a `statusLine` hook script — it is not symlinked-by-reference; a profile must opt in via its own `settings.json`, which is not tracked in this repo).
Agents are single `.md` files fetched and tracked by `resource-manager.sh` (see "Skill & agent source management").
- **`plugins.txt` is desired-state only.**
  Installation is manual per-profile; the Makefile only reports drift.
  Lines are `<name>@<marketplace>`; blanks and `#` comments are ignored.
- **Several `.gitignore`'d paths live in the tree but are not checked in.**
  The vendored skill dirs (a managed block in `.gitignore`, one `/skills/<name>/` line each — rewritten by `resource-manager.sh`) are materialized from `skills/vendored.json`, so after a fresh clone they're absent until `make install` (or `make skills-materialize`) reconstructs them.
  `docs/superpowers/` holds local-only design artifacts (brainstorming specs, implementation plans).
  `skills/bin/` holds the `parakeet-cpp-transcribe` binary the `transcribe` skill downloads at runtime — under the symlinked profiles its `../bin` resolves back into the repo, so it's ignored to keep the blob out of git.
  Don't expect any of these to be present after a fresh clone.

## Conventions when editing

- Keep skills atomic, easy to maintain, and reusable/composable.
  Each skill should do one well-scoped thing so it can be invoked on its own or chained with others, rather than bundling several unrelated workflows.
  Prefer extracting shared logic into a script the skill calls over duplicating it across skills, and keep `SKILL.md` focused enough that another skill (or the model) can lean on it without inheriting unrelated behavior.
  When a skill needs another skill, reference it by name as a soft dependency instead of copying its contents.
- Treat vendored skill dirs and `pi/extensions/` as read-only upstream copies — for vendored skills the dir is gitignored and `make skills-materialize`/`skills-update` overwrites it wholesale from the pinned commit, so local edits there are lost with no trace.
  If you genuinely need to diverge from a vendored skill, **reclassify it as authored**: restore the committed dir, rewrite its `.source.json` to `{"repo": null, ...}` with a `note` recording the fork point, drop it from `skills/vendored.json` and the `.gitignore` block (that's exactly what was done for `itr-india`) — then it's committed and safe to edit.
- The committed record for a vendored skill is its `skills/vendored.json` entry, not the on-disk `.source.json` (which is gitignored and regenerated on materialize); change a vendored skill's source by re-fetching/updating, which rewrites the manifest entry.
  For agents and authored skills, the `.source.json` sidecar is still the committed record but is likewise regenerated on fetch/update — don't hand-edit it expecting persistence.
  Authored resources (no upstream) keep a `{"repo": null}` sidecar so they survive `skills-update-all` / `agents-update-all` untouched.
- When adding a new profile, update `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS` (Makefile line 9) — it drives both the CLAUDE.md and skills symlink loops.
